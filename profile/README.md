## Welcome to SA4S Research Group 👋

SA4S research group, SERC works at the intersection of software architecture and machine learning, focusing on building sustainable and self-adaptive software systems. We explore how software architecture principles can be combined with advanced machine learning techniques to tackle the challenges of designing resilient, energy-efficient, and adaptive systems.
Our vision is to create systems that are not only functional but also sustainable and self-adaptable in an ever-changing world.
